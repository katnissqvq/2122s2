MICHAEL MOORE, JESSE JACKSON TO HOLD ELECTION EVE 'GET OUT THE VOTE' RALLY IN FLINT, MI

RALLY WIll INCLUDE FREE SCREENING OF MOORE'S ""TRUMPLAND"" FILM 

(FLNIT, MI Nov. 6, 2016) With a tightened race now seeming to come down to the battleground state of Michigan, Oscar-winning filmmaker and Flint-native Michael Moore has announced he will hold a ""raucous, impassioned"" election eve rally and free screening of his new film ""Michael Moore In TrumpLand"" at Flint's Whiting Auditorium on Monday evening. 

And coming as Moore's special guest will be none other than civil rights icon and former Presidential candidate Rev. Jesse Jackson.

""The fact that Donald Trump is within striking distance of winning the state of Michigan is a wake-up call to all decent people,"" said Moore, a prominent Bernie Sanders supporter who has been an outspoken Clinton backer in the general election. ""We must have a significant turnout on Tuesday for Hillary in order to repudiate the hate from the Trump campaign and move Flint and the country forward.""

""I am honored to join Michael Moore and return to Flint, a city that has gripped the conscience of a nation on more than one occasion,"" said Rev. Jackson. ""No one must stay home this Tuesday. To do so would dishonor all who have come before us.""

Moore, who has historically held gala premiers and screenings of each of his films at The Whiting, is hosting this screening of his latest documentary as part of a ""get out the vote"" effort in Michigan that on Monday will see Hillary Clinton visiting Grand Rapids, Bill Clinton speaking in Lansing and President Obama appearing at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Trump has also announced he will close out his campaign tomorrow night in Michigan. 

Moore, in addition to showing his 73-minute film on the big screen at The Whiting, will also speak, as will Jesse Jackson along with a number of other invited guests. Moore says there many even be ""a little surprise"" at the event. In the past, those little surprises have included Moore bringing on the stage Roseanne Barr, Phil Donahue and members of Rage Against the Machine.

Moore first brought Rev. Jackson to Flint in 1984 in an effort to elect Flint's first elected African American mayor. The rally was successful in helping James Sharp win that election two days later. 

In 1988, Moore again brought Presidential candidate jackson to Michigan to campaign during that year's presidential primary. The effort was again successful as Jackson won the Michigan primary, defeating Michael Dukakis. 

""Jesse is our good luck charm, for sure!"" Moore added. ""We will settle for nothing less this week.""

""Michael Moore In TrumpLand"" is a surprise new film that Moore made over 12 days in Ohio just last month. It immediately shot to #1 on iTunes nationwide and has remained there. Theatrically it is playing in 61 cities and set the all-time opening day box office record at its premiere theater in New York City. It holds the largest opening weekend per-screen average of any documentary in North America for 2016. 

The film covers Moore performing a one-man show he wrote for the people in the Republican-dominated town of Wilmington, Ohio. Critics have called it one of his best and the New Yorker magazine called it ""majectic."" 

The Whiting rally will begin at 7pm on Monday and is free and open to the public. Tickets will be handed out beginning at 11am Monday morning at the Whiting box office. 

""I hope to see a few thousand people in Flint show up,"" said Moore. ""No city in America knows better what happens when Republican policies are set in motion to harm people. Hillary was the first candidate to come to Flint and speak out against the disastrous decisions that were made which poisoned the city's water supply. She has repeatedly made it clear that Flint and its people will be at the top of her agenda."" 

Congressman Dan Kildee will also speak.

The revolution's success depends on people taking their anger and motivation out of FB debate pages and people's FB walls and directing them IRL. Everyone should have their senators and house reps on speed dial. You should be writing letters to the editor of your local paper. Most certainly you should be communicating your displeasure with the corporate media, who have slanted this election from the beginning with both censorship and blatant propaganda. 

#RealProgressives need to be IRL activists for the cause.

The year 2015 marks the 150th anniversary of The Nation Magazine. Join a conversation about The Nation's and the nation's past, present and future with Katrina vanden Heuvel, D.D. Guttenplan, Khalil Muhammad and Bob Herbert. Moderated by Laura Flanders.

Special comments from Mychal Denzel Smith, Sarah Leonard and Michelle Chen plus audience questions will follow the initial conversation.

The event is free of charge, but we expect to reach capacity. Please use this link to reserve your seat: https://americashiddenhistorynyc.eventbrite.com

Book sales and signing will follow the program. 

The story of The Nation is also the story of our country.  For the past 150 years, America's hidden history—of domestic oppression and overseas conquest, but also of opposition and resistance—has been recorded in the magazine's pages.  

Over the decades that opposition has had many names from the patrician reformers of the 1860s through a vast array of political and economic struggles to more recent fights against corporate globalization, free trade, economic inequality the destruction of the environment and police brutality.

As many of you know my first new film in 6 years, WHERE TO INVADE NEXT, had its world premiere last night and the response was OVERWHELMING! The screening sold out within the first hour, and I know many of you were disappointed you couldn't get in. I believe the festival will add another screening or two for next week, but in the meantime I wanted to do something special for all of my Canadian Facebook friends and the people who won't get a chance to see the film this week.

So, today I'm announcing a way for ANYONE to be able to hang out with me and my crew and talk movies and whatever. Free invite for everybody TODAY @ 4PM! Below are the details...

This is for anyone in the Toronto area this weekend...

Friday, Sept. 11th @ 4PM - You are all invited to my party after the Friday (Sept. 11th) screening. We are calling this event, the PEOPLE'S PARTY! It's free. You don't need to be a VIP. There's no velvet rope. It's enough if you'd just like to hang for a bit with me and my crew. The first 100 people who show up to this address below will get in to our private event and there will be food a drink on me! If you are 101 in line, don't worry there still a chance to get in! We are also saving 100 spots for this event for anyone who has a ticket to my Friday screening as well. 200 lucky spots for any folks who want to come down and hang out with us on our special day. Come on down and have a drink on me!

Here are the details for the 4PM event:
